**Description**

This is an implementation of the A* algorithm to pathfind through a mountain range minimizing both vertical and horizontal movement.

**How to Use**

The Pathfinding.py file will find the best path through the mountains and will also determine the best starting location as well. If you want, you can limit the algorithm to one starting location by removing the for loop and assigning the variable to the chosen location. The project prints out a png of the mountain range and the best determined path. You can alter the coefficients of the scoring system to your liking to weigh things higher if you desire.
